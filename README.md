fun to go back and use some better design to make it look more updated. still need to learn  how to crop pictures better, but not too big of a concern at the moment.

No bootstrap or javascript used in this one, only some basic css and html work to make it function. will give it a proper update in due time, but for now, it is just a place to put links to better made things.
