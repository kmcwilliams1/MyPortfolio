is this the right readme? this is like, my third try.
im still not sure how to get an image on one of these bad boys.
i think i have to do it in vscode, but it wont push a screenshot to git hub.
im probably doing something wrong, as per usual.

my other read me has all the changes ive made, but the short and skinny is, i gotta learn how to proofread. 
i keep misspelling words that i shouldnt be! 
but after numerous attempts im ready to submit it, assuming i can get this link thing to work properly.
i had some help from a tutor, and several office hours. 
but css is starting to click! just in time to move on to java script...
does anyone even read these or can i just type randomly?  
if anyone is reading, did they ever find that Malaysia flight?
